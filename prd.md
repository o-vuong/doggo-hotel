# **Product Requirements Document (PRD): Dog Boarding Facility Management System**

## **1. Project Overview & Goals**

### **1.1 Objective**

To design and implement a **scalable, secure, and role-based dog boarding facility management system** that efficiently handles **reservations, pet management, staff workflows, payments, compliance tracking, and industry standard legal requirements**.

### **1.2 Key Features**

- **Multi-Role Access Control** – Admins, Managers, Staff, PetOwners, with stacked permissions.
- **Dynamic Booking & Availability Management** – Real-time scheduling, waitlists, and conflict resolution.
- **Automated Payments & Refunds** – Stripe integration for cashless transactions.
- **Comprehensive Pet Management** – ClientPets and EmployeePets handled separately.
- **Security & Compliance** – Role-based restrictions, abandonment handling, and legal agreements.
- **Industry Standard Legal Forms and Compliance Enforcement** – Integration of all legally required forms and contracts.
- **Automated & Manual Compliance Tracking** – System will automatically enforce key compliance policies (e.g., vaccination verification, payment authorizations), while admins will retain the ability to manually review and override compliance flags where necessary.
